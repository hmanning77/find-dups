find-dups
=========

Overview
--------
This is just a simple exercise in Rust while I learn the language. The aim is
simply to walk the current directory and subdirectories, generate a hash of
each file, and use those hashes to detect duplicates.

Todo
----
* Add comments
* Get someone who knows Rust to provide criticism
* Find out why it is so slow (`hash.sh` runs in less than a fifth of the time)
